# Functions 
# len(), int(), print() all are examples of buildt in functions.
print("Hello")
num_char = len("Hello")
print(num_char)

# all above are inbuilt

# to create ours do def for definition
def my_funtion():
    print("hello")
    print("bye")
    
# To call the funtion do
my_funtion()
# we get all prints in the console

# visit Reeborg's World

# Indentation 

# def my_function():
#     if sky == "clear":
#         print("blue")
#     elif sky =="cloudy":
#         print("grey")
#     print("Hello")
# print("World")

# in this code we have so many indents with each line belonging to each block
# Spaces Vs. Tabs

### While Loop ###

# While using for look we looped through a list or a range of numbers
# in While we do
# While something_is_true:
#   do something

# Only when something becomes false the loop is exited
# check coding challenge file

# NOTE: for loops are good for iteration e.g. for lists and with a range
# NOTE: while doesnt care about numbers but runs code awaiting a result (sometimes dangerous) 
# why because if our condition never equals FALSE then we get an infinite loop e.g. while 5 > 3 this is 
# an infinte loop because 5 would always be greater than three
